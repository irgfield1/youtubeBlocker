# Youtube Tracker Extension
## Purpose
Youtube Tracker/Blocker is intended to effectively block specific youtube videos, or allow only specific videos
This Extension works on firefox

## Known Bugs
Doesn't work on Chrome
Whitelist/blacklist implementation fails because the originUrl persists within tab
maybe the ei property changes, so I can block requests based on that.....
regex.match not working, using regex.test but not sure why
No CSS in options.css
No youtube api - block channel functionality...
